# Schoolbot-App
Welcome to my School-Bot App. This was a collaborative group project to create a UX/UI co-creative artificial intelligence app that targets one of the world's sustainable goals. My group and I designed a prototype app that uses co-creative AI to create a personalized curriculum for non-traditional students or students who do not have access to quality education. We conducted interviews, user testing, collected usability data, and created wireframes, storyboards, personas, user journeys, and high/low fidelity prototypes.

The final design report for this project includes a comprehensive review of the design process, from initial goals to evaluation. The report begins by reflecting on the design goals, which were shaped by user research and focus group studies, and are categorized into three key areas: the design challenge, user tasks, and usability issues. It features detailed personas and storyboards, which represent the target users and how the design addresses their needs. The interaction design is illustrated through wireframes and annotated using the COFI framework to showcase the user journey. A functional prototype is presented, with links to an interactive version and a demonstration video. The evaluation section describes the usability studies conducted, detailing participant tasks, data collection, and analysis, along with recommended design changes. The report also addresses potential ethical issues and includes an appendix with transcribed user study data. The document is structured with a cover page, table of contents, and a list of figures.
