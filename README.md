# Schoolbot-App
Welcome to my School-Bot App. This was a collaborative group project to create a UX/UI co-creative artificial intelligence app that targets one of the world's sustainable goals. My group and I designed a prototype app that uses co-creative AI to create a personalized curriculum for non-traditional students or students who do not have access to quality education. We conducted interviews, user testing, collected usability data, and created wireframes, storyboards, personas, user journeys, and high/low fidelity prototypes.

Thank you for visiting!
